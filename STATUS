Branch

- Implemented and running.
- We need to modify the script so that it creates Chapel procs instead
  of C functions.

DGEMM

- Implemented and running.

NStream

- Implemented and running.

PIC

- MISSING
- Looked complicated but could be a good addition

Random

- Implemented and running
- There is a minor discrepency in the created data, compared to OpenMP.
  This disappears when run with 1 thread per locale, leading me to
  believe that there is a race condition while using the homegrown RNG.

Reduce

- MISSING
- This seems to rely on first-touch memory allocation. Which may not be
  very easy to emulate in Chapel.

Refcount

- MISSING

Sparse

- Implemented and running
- Performance seemed too good to be true

Stencil

- Implemented and running
- Performance seemed muich better than OpenMP, leading me to believe
  that there might be some subtle implementation difference
- But than again it was forked from upstream

Synch_*

- MISSING
- These seems to rely on first-touch memory allocation. Which may not be
  very easy to emulate in Chapel.

Transpose

- Implemented and running
